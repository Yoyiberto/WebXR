# WebXR Augmented Reality Demonstration
This project is a proof-of-concept for rendering interactive 3D models in a web browser, designed as a foundational test for mobile WebXR and Augmented Reality experiences.

It showcases the dynamic loading and display of 3D penguin assets in a navigable scene. Users can interact with the environment using standard controls to rotate the view and zoom, simulating a basic 3D viewer that can be extended for AR on a smartphone.

The core goal is to provide a lightweight, accessible example of how WebXR can bring immersive AR content to the web, eliminating the need for native app installations.
